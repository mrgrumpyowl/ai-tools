# AI Development Toolkit

Welcome to the AI Development Toolkit repository. This toolkit is designed to facilitate the development, interaction, and deployment of AI models, with a particular focus on GPT-4, through Python interfaces and automation scripts. It includes a Python Chat Interface for GPT-4 and a README Generator script to streamline project documentation processes. Additionally, the repository contains various git and bash scripting utilities for managing and automating git operations, particularly in the context of AI development projects.

## Features

- **Python Chat Interface for GPT-4**: A user-friendly Python-based command-line interface for interacting with OpenAI's GPT-4 model. It supports multiline input, real-time response loading, and enhanced output formatting.
- **README Generator**: A Python script that automates the generation of `README.md` files for projects by processing text files within a directory and leveraging OpenAI's API for content creation.
- **Git and Bash Scripting Utilities**: Tools and scripts for managing git workflows, including pre-commit hooks and git command configurations tailored for AI development projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `openai`, `prompt_toolkit`, and `rich` Python packages for the Python Chat Interface
- `openai` Python package for the README Generator
- Git for version control

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages for the respective tools you intend to use:

```bash
pip install openai prompt_toolkit rich
```

3. Configure your OpenAI API key as per the instructions [here](https://openai.com/api/).

### Usage

#### Python Chat Interface for GPT-4

Navigate to the directory containing `chat_with_gpt4.py` and run:

```bash
python chat_with_gpt4.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with GPT-4.

#### README Generator

Place `generate_readme.py` in the root directory of your project and run:

```bash
python generate_readme.py
```

The script will process text files in the directory and subdirectories, generating a `README.md` file.
